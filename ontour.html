                After the SFIFF screening of ON Tour, the cast of cabaret New Burlesque goes on tour of Northern France (MAY) and Speleto Italy (July). In early July the troupe collaborates with the popular &quot;new Gainsbourg&quot; Philipe Katrine at a huge rock festival. The troupe is represented by the same touring agency as Woody Allen , Ute Lemper, and Marianne Faithfull!<br>
                <br>
                ON TOUR stars Amalric himself as a producer who brings an American Neo-Burlesque troupe to France, played by genuine performers Mi Mi Le Meaux, Kitten on the Keys, Dirty Martini, Julie Atlas Muz, Roky Roulette (SF), and Evie Lovelle. In a road movie narrative, the plot follows the troupe as they tour French port cities with their show, which was actually performed for actual audiences during the production. The inspiration for the film was a book by Colette about her experience from music halls in the early 20th Century, and part of Amalric's aim was to translate the sentiment of the book into a modern setting.<br>
                Kitten says of her role in On Tour:<br>
                &quot;I play a character loosely based on my burlesque alter ego Kitten on the Keys-the bawdy piano playing singing Mistress of Ceremonies. On stage I am usually WAY over the top, humorous and outrageous BUT this film shows a responsible , together woman. She help's Mathieu's scattered cheap character Joachim by getting the burlesque troupe to the next seedy port town theater by train, helping his kids find a place to sleep, and basically tells him to &quot;get bent&quot; because of his ill attitude towards this female centric show. I get to sing and play piano and ukulele in Haute Burlesque creations by locals San Francisco designers Jessica Landsdown and my long term costumer Monique Motil. I get to rock out to some unexpected musical numbers byt Radiohead and Aerosmith. During the actual filming of ON TOUR we played several port towns around the western Coast of France where I entertained the real show audience with my one woman musical schtick and played selections by Piaf, Brel, Trenet, Gainsbourg, Josephine Baker and others. <br>
                <br>
                The back story on how Kitten got cast:<br>
                I got discovered in 2003 in LA&nbsp; as the musical Mistress of Ceremonies for San Francisco&nbsp; TEASE-O-Rama Burlesque Showcase by a cultural curator Kitty Hartl who worked for a big French Cultural Institution Le Lui Unique. MiMi le Meaux,<br>
                Dirty Martini and I are the &quot;Original Gangstas&quot; of the show Cabaret New Burlesque that was put together for the IDEAL Festival in Nantes France. We came back to France several times including a stint at Le Zebre in Paris where a photo of our neo-burlesque troupe in the newspaper LIBERATION caught actor and director Mathieu Amalric's eye. He felt like we reflected the spirit of Collette's stories from her days in Music Hall he was searching for. A new cast of Cabaret New Burlesque was set up to do a three month residency for an arts festival on an island in Nantes France and Mathieu and his screenwriting partner Philippe De Folco came to see a few of our shows. He had never even realized straight men do burlesque too and was curious about San Francisco Artist Roky Roulette. Mathieu started scouting for burlesque artists at all of the conventions like Tease-o-rama at Bimbos in San Francisco and even flew to Napoli Italy to watch one of our shows there. Somehow we always stayed in touch with Mathieu. I had no idea how respected he was in France. I thought he was going to hire skinny French actresses who smoke too much for our roles and POOF! He called me in December 2009 and I screamed in a Mission District fabric store-WOWZA-My Life is gonna change!<br>
                <br>
                Mathieu is an astute intellectual guy. He definately made the film&nbsp; a collaborative project. Although ON TOUR did not have a script but a loose outline, we were able to interject what we would do as our own burlesque chacters in those situations. I like talking about the history of film and music with him. He is a real thinker. When I am in Paris I am lucky enough to be put up in his spare room and I take his kids to the cinema plus I gave his baby a crazy stuffed&nbsp; animal platypus that he carries with him everywhere! We are like one extended super kooky family. He came to see my solo piano show in Paris last year. He really cares and stays in touch! Plus I just ran into him on the METRO in Paris-he is a real down to earth guy who has had one amazing life.<br>
